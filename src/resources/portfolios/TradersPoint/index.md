# Traders Point 2020

I made sets of different designs for the team, here is an example of three of the coach's bios that I made for the teams introductory meeting at the beginning of the year. I was only provided the information to include and a few pictures for each coach and allowed to create anything. I was also given the opportunity to create the gameday posters that were created by the team, with some of my favorites included.
