# JaguarBoard Branding

This was the final project for my Design 4405 class at Ohio State. The idea was to find a product or service from the real world and create a branding identity for it. Looking on Kickstarter, I came across the [JaguarBoard](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/263025908/jaguarboard-x86-based-single-board-computer).

---

I selected the JaguarBoard because there was no apparent branding on the Kickstarter page, so I would be able to start with a clean slate. Just a picture of the board and a name.

---

After selecting the product, we began the process with moodboards, acquiring different images from around the internet that I thought would fit the tech feel I was going for, while still being true to the name of the Jaguar.

---

After receiving feedback on my moodboard, I went through several iterations of coming up with a logo that would work. Ending with this straight on shot of a jaguar's head.

---

After coming up with a logo, I filled out a branding board complete with the logo, design elements, possible icons, colors and fonts that would be used for headings and body.

---

Next, we began creating mockups of actual products that our customers would use. I selected to make one of them to be a business card mockup and ended up with this, using design elements from the branding board.

---

I also created a mockup of the box that the JaguarBoard would ship in. Again, using design elements from the branding board. This image is a sleeve that would go around the simpler box with more information.

---

At the halfway point and at the end, we gave presentations to the class of what we worked on. You can find PDFs of the two presentations I made [here](images/portfolio/jaguarboard/Presentation1.pdf) and [here](images/portfolio/jaguarboard/Presentation2.pdf).
