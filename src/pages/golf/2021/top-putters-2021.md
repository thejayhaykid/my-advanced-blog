# Best Designed Putters of 2021

Being left handed and having a tight golf budget means I do not get to physically try out a lot of putters. I have my own Odyssey White Hot Pro blade putter and then the 10ish or so options at my local golf shop for lefties to try out (the place has over 300 right handed options though). That being what it is, I figured I could employ a different skill in order to rank my favorite putters of 2021, design. There are loads of reviews out there that will tell you all about the feel and weight and impact of different putters, but I focus soley on the design from a visual perspective.

This is not just the look of the putter, but also the marketing and digital design team around that. I understand that the big companies have very big and talented design and marketing teams, but there is also a lot of bad design in the golf world and I'm trying to change that. Some areas need pulled out of the 90's or older. But here are some examples that are doing it right, in no particular order.

## [Odyssey Triple Track Ten Putter](https://www.odysseygolf.com/triple-track/putters-2020-triple-track-ten.html)

I love everything about the Triple Track from Odyssey and Callaway, the purpose, the colors, the execution, all of it. Ultimately, I think the Ten is the best looking mallet putter that Odyssey makes and combined with the Triple Track it looks amazing. This design is clearly inspired by the TaylorMade Spider, but this also has the classic Odyssey white face. I do own this putter and it is my current gamer. How much I love the look is a big part of why I picked it up.

This is the putter that my dad currently uses, so I have seen this one in action as well. He is right handed, like most people, so I don't have any use experience with actually putting with it. But my dad loves all of his PXG clubs and I trust his opinion on use. Design wise, this is a great looking putter.

## [Ping 2021 Anser 4](https://ping.com/en-us/clubs/putters/ping-2021)

Ping knows how to make putters and Anser is Ping at their best. I will always love a black and red color scheme. It looks very clean. Love the look of it.

## [Scotty Cameron Phantom X 12](https://www.scottycameron.com/putters/phantom-x/phantom-x-12/)

The Newport is the classic Scotty, with it's design that steals from the Anser like most blade putters do nowadays. But the Phantom X 12 is a great shape, I love the milled face. If I took any points off, it would be for the yellow used. The yellow is unique, but not a color that looks that great on the golf course.

## [Stix Putter](https://stix.golf/products/putter)

This is a nice looking, mid-mallet putter from a DTC brand. It is clean and simple. And again, I am partial to a black and red color scheme.
