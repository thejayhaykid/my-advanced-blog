# JaguarBoard Branding

This was the final project for my Design 4405 class at Ohio State. The idea was to find a product or service from the real world and create a branding identity for it. Looking on Kickstarter, I came across the [JaguarBoard](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/263025908/jaguarboard-x86-based-single-board-computer).

I selected the JaguarBoard because there was no apparent branding on the Kickstarter page, so I would be able to start with a clean slate. Just a picture of the board and a name.

After selecting the product, we began the process with moodboards, acquiring different images from around the internet that I thought would fit the tech feel I was going for, while still being true to the name of the Jaguar.

After receiving feedback on my moodboard, I went through several iterations of coming up with a logo that would work. Ending with this straight on shot of a jaguar's head.

After coming up with a logo, I filled out a branding board complete with the logo, design elements, possible icons, colors and fonts that would be used for headings and body.

Next, we began creating mockups of actual products that our customers would use. I selected to make one of them to be a business card mockup and ended up with this, using design elements from the branding board.

I also created a mockup of the box that the JaguarBoard would ship in. Again, using design elements from the branding board. This image is a sleeve that would go around the simpler box with more information.

At the halfway point and at the end, we gave presentations to the class of what we worked on. You can find PDFs of the two presentations I made [here](images/portfolio/jaguarboard/Presentation1.pdf) and [here](images/portfolio/jaguarboard/Presentation2.pdf).
