# Day 1

## Prompt

![user image](/images/blog/design/thirty-logos/day-1/user.png)

> Hey Designer!
>
> I'm Mary, the project coordinator at Space. We're so happy to have you work on our logo design! Space is building coworking offices so that freelancers and small startup companies have a stunning office to work out of without paying the big bucks to buy or lease a large building.
>
> We offer rentable offices for teams of 1 to 12 in beautiful areas across the world including Austin, New York City, Raleigh, Chicago, San Francisco, and London. These offices are also great for people working remote for larger companies.
>
> For the Space logo, we want to capture the idea of a personal, modern, and fun shared office space. We would be open to some kind of icon or using the text "Space" to represent the company. We don't have any requirements in terms of colors, text, icon, or otherwise. Have fun with some ideas!
>
> And if this helps, some of our competitors are Industrious and WeWork.
>
> Regards,
> 
> Mary Anderson
> **Space - Project Coordinator**
