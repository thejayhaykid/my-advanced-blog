## Introduction

I will be working through the [Logo Core Logo Challenge](https://www.logocore.com/logo-challenge/). I currently do not have the availability to complete it in the 30 days, but I will try to complete it as fast as possible. I am hoping to complete it within 60 days, but I don't have any way of guaranteeing that.

It has been a number of years since I stretched my "logo design" muscles, but I have been reviewing some of my notes from classes I took in college and watching some YouTube videos to try to remember some of the tips and tricks I learned back then and even linked some of those videos below. I will say I do not claim to know much of anything about logo design, I'm hoping this challenge will teach me some things. The videos have been created by professional logo designers so I would listen to them before listening to anything that I might say.
